WELD-CHECK,"Weld Check software is a powerful, easy-to-use tool that enhances the ability to quickly and efficiently measure critical welding features such as fillet welds, throat, leg lengths and penetration.
Fillet weld example: a fillet weld of approximately triangular cross section joining two surfaces at approximately right angles to each other can be measured for the following important measurements:
- Distance from the foot of the fillet to the center of the face (or throat)
-Distance from the root of the joint to the junction between the exposed surface of the weld and the base metal (leg)
-Angles and the root penetration
-Depth of HAZ (heat affected zone)
-Area of HAZ
-Joint penetration
-Phase counting, etc.
Weld Check is a Microsoft Windows based product so reports are easily generated in MS Excel.
